  abstract = {J.N. Reddy's, An Introduction to the Finite Element Method, 
              third edition is an update of one of the most popular FEM 
              textbooks available. The book retains its strong conceptual 
              approach, clearly examining the mathematical underpinnings 
              of FEM, and providing a general approach of engineering 
              application areas. Known for its detailed, carefully selected 
              example problems and extensive selection of homework problems, 
              the author has comprehensively covered a wide range of 
              engineering areas making the book approriate for all engineering 
              majors, and underscores the wide range of use FEM has in 
              the professional world. A supplementary text Web site located 
              at http://www.mhhe.com/reddy3e contains password-protected 
              solutions to end-of-chapter problems, general textbook information,
              supplementary chapters on the FEM1D and FEM2D computer programs,
